# scattergoriesGUI
A GUI that replaces the dice in the Scattergories board game. Generates random legal letters for gameplay.

## Motivation for Creation
Scattergories is a simple board game about coming up with words to fit a specific category given a random letter. The game comes with a dice that has all the letters of the alphabet on it except for the near impossible letter that would break the game (Q, V, X, Z). If this dice is lost, the game cannot be played properly.

## What I Learned
-Building a GUI with swing
